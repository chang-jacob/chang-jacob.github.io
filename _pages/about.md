I'm a Ph.D. student in Biomedical Data Science at Stanford University, advised by [Dr. Sylvia Plevritis](https://plevritislab.stanford.edu/). I am interested in the intersection of health, biotechnology, policy, and law. 

<!-- My research interests are in biostatistics and computational methods development for the analysis of spatial omics data.  -->

I'm originally from Mililani, Hawai'i, and I attended the University of Notre Dame, where I earned bachelor's degrees in Statistics and Sociology. Before graduate school, I worked as a Data Scientist at [84.51&deg;](https://www.8451.com/), where I worked on both the Health and Wellness Pharmacy Team and the Algorithmic Fairness Team. As a graduate student, I have interned as a computational biologist and bioinformatician at Genentech and Amgen. 

Outside of research, I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time with my wife and dogs. I can occasionally be found running, but I enjoy this significantly less!

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
